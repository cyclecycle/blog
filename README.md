## Development

```bash
npm start
```

## Making a post

Add posts in markdown format to `/posts` then import them in `src/posts.ts`.

Posts should have metadata at the top in the following format:

```markdown
---
name: post-name
date: 2021-01-01
tags: [tag1, tag2]
---
```

And should start with a h1 heading:

```markdown
# Post title
```

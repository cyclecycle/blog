# The Challenges Ahead:<br />A Look at the Open Problems in AI

Here we look at the open problem areas in AI. This is a high-level overview of the challenges of the field, and the goals that we are working towards. The purpose of this is to provide a starting point for thinking about the development of AI systems, and the role of research in addressing these challenges.

## Open challenges - Maximising the potential of AI

The challenge of AI is to build systems that maximise the following traits:

- **Intelligence**
- **Adaptability**
- **Efficiency**
- **Interpretability**
- **Morality**
- **Collaboration**
- **Applicability**

We will look at each of traits in more detail below.

### Intelligence

Intelligence is the ability to learn, reason, and solve complex problems. Increasingly intelligent systems can help solve harder problems, improve decision making, and automate tasks that would be difficult or impossible for humans to perform. The ultimate goal is to create systems that exhibit super intelligent behavior, surpassing human intelligence in all areas.

#### Current state

Machine learning algorithms, particularly neural networks, have enabled systems to learn from data without explicit programming. In this way, systems have been able to exhibit increasingly intelligent behaviour purely as a result of predictive modelling over that data. This has allowed them to perform tasks such as recognizing objects in images, understanding natural language, and playing complex games.

The gap with respect to human intelligence has decreased as systems have become increasingly dominant in specific domains. These systems are considered narrow however. Systems will need to become more general and able to learn from a wider range of data and situations.

### Adaptability

Adaptable systems can operate in a wider range of contexts and environments, improving their flexibility and generalisability. This can be particularly useful in real-world applications where conditions may change over time. The ultimate goal is to create systems that are able to adapt to new situations and environments quickly and effectively by applying their knowledge to new contexts.

#### Current state

AI systems have traditionally been designed to work in specific contexts and environments, with limited ability to adapt to new situations. This makes it difficult to apply them in real-world settings where conditions are highly variable and change over time.

Recent developments in machine learning, such as transfer learning and meta-learning, have enabled systems to adapt to new contexts. These techniques allow systems to learn from a smaller amount of data and to generalise their knowledge to new contexts.

There is still much work to be done in this area to create truly adaptable systems that can operate effectively in a wide range of environments.

### Efficiency

Efficiency is the ability to use resources effectively and efficiently. This ability can enable AI systems to run faster, use less power, and handle larger amounts of data, making them more practical and cost-effective to use. The ultimate goal is to create systems that can be trained and deployed at very low effort and cost.

#### Current state

The best AI systems are extremely resource-intensive. They require large amounts of data, computing power, and energy to operate. This limits adoption and progress as deploying and studying these systems is expensive.

Recent developments in hardware design have enabled more efficient systems, but there is still a huge amount of progress to make in developing efficient algorithms that can learn from smaller amounts of data and use less power to operate.

### Interpretability

Interpretability is the ability to explain and understand how a system makes its decisions. This is required to help users understand and trust its actions. This becomes more important as the impact of the decision increases. The ultimate goal is to create systems that are able to provide clear justification for their decisions, at the level that we expect from humans.

#### Current state

As machine learning systems have become more sophisticated, they have become more opaque and difficult to interpret. With current systems it is very difficult or impossible for users to understand why a particular decision has been made.

This is an area of growing focus, as the lack of interpretability is a significant barrier to adoption in many applications. Some techniques have been developed, but these are mainly bolt-ons that are very limited.

### Morality

Morality refers to the principles and values that guide our behavior and decision-making. Sufficiently developed systems will respect ethical principles and norms, protecting the interests of individuals and society as a whole. The ultimate goal is to create systems that are able to understand and act in accordance with moral principles and values.

#### Current state

The behaviour of AI systems is determined by the data and algorithms used to train them. If the data and algorithms are biased or unethical, the system will reflect those biases and act in ways that may be harmful or unethical.

There has been a growing awareness in the development of AI systems. This has led to the development of new frameworks and guidelines for ethical AI, as well as research into the design of moral AI systems.

However, there is no consensus on what principles and values should guide their behavior, and how they should be implemented in practice.

### Collaboration

Collaboration is the process of working effectively with others to achieve a common goal. Collaborative AI systems will be able to more effectively transfer their expertise and augment human performance. The goal is to create systems that are able to work effectively with humans and other systems to achieve common goals.

#### Current state

Current AI systems operate mostly independently, without the need for coordination or collaboration with other systems. However, the need for collaboration is becoming increasingly important to transfer the benefits of AI to humans.

### Applicability

This refers to how readily a system can be applied to solve real-world problems and achieve specific goals. Ultimately this determines a system's utility and value. The goal is to make systems that are not only capable of solving problems, but are easy and affordable enough to be practical for use in most real-world settings.

#### Current state

Current AI systems show great promise, but are difficult to adopt for reasons related to all of the above problem areas.

## Conclusion

This high-level list helps guide my thinking on the areas of development that improvements in the field should deliver, and where the opportunities for innovation lie.

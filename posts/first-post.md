# My first post

Why write things and put them out for others to read?

## Why write things?

I find that the more I write, the more grounded I feel with my ideas and plans. I feel more clear and confident about them, and lighter for having turned them into words.

## Why put them out for others to read?

I have found that showing myself to others brings me feelings of freedom, connection, and completion, which I like. Showing things that I have created and, more so, the process of creating things, is a way of showing myself to others. Putting out things I've written is a way of feeling this.

In the software trade, people say "ship early and often". I believe in the power of this. Regularly putting out things that I have written is a way of practising this and making it even more a part of my life.

Also, writing tends to drive me to read more, as I look for answers to questions that I have while writing. This drive is all the stronger if what you write may be read by others. I enjoy learning and growth and so I welcome these drives.

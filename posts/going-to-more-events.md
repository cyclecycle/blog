# Going to More Events

I have found that going to events where I can meet people who are doing interesting things is probably the most beneficial type of thing I have done for myself from a work point of view. I want to do more of this. What's the best system to help me go to more events in-person?

## Sharing space

In fact, it's not just events, but simply being around others that creates opportunities, like in a coffee shop or coworking space, where the opportunity to meet people is always there. But when I go to an event alone I will almost always meet someone new, whereas in a coffee shop or coworking space it is fairly rare that I meet someone new. If meeting new people is the goal, then I should focus first on going to more events.

## From theory to practice

### Problem

I need to discover what events are happening around me. This requires a habit of regularly checking various sources. This is a problem for me. I don't have this habit and I don't want to have to think about it.

### Solution

What I think I really want is this: a system which tells me about events that are happening in my area, and puts them on my calendar. The only habit that is required then is to check my calendar.

There are event aggregators. I have found them great but lacking. For example, I also want to know about local gigs and small events, which might only be found on social media or the hosts website. I also want to know about events that are happening at the theatre or local music venues. I have not found a single aggregator or feed that covers all of these.

#### Build it

I have decided that this would be a good opportunity for a fun project. I want to build a system that will do this for me.

I am thinking about a system where:

- I use existing event aggregators if I can
- Pull events from them which I can then filter with my own approaches
- Create entries in my calendar for events that pass the filter
    - Maybe also email a list of events to myself
- Also, I can add a list of web pages to check for events
- Use an event extraction model to extract events from these pages
    - These will then go through the filtering and calendar entry steps

## Conclusion

If I can build this system or find something that helps me reach the same goal, I will have to some degree solved this problem. It will help me to go to more events and meet more people, which I consider to be a very good goal.

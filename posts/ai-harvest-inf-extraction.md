# AI Harvest: Reaping the Benefits of Information Extraction

As a product developer and AI enthusiast, I'm looking for opportunities to apply AI to solve real-world problems and augment the capabilities of individuals. One area where this can be done is in using information extraction techniques to help gather and structure information from documents and other sources. This is an exploration of the areas where AI can be used to build products that use information extraction techniques to help people in their work.

## Intelligent assistants for gathering information

Information extraction is the process of identifying and collecting specific types of information from a source such as a document and putting it in a structure that is useful for the task at hand.

Information in this case refers to the task-relevant data that is contained in a data source. This could be names, concepts, dates, relationships, and so on. It is entirely dependent on the application. The source of the information will be called a document. This could be an web page, research article, meeting transcript, legal contract, medical record, etc.

Information extraction can be thought of as a two-step process: identifying patterns of interest, and generating an that captures them in the desired format. This latter step might be as simple as listing concepts in a singular form, when they have might have been expressed in a plural form in the document. Or it might be more complicated such as expressing a relationship that has been expressed in a document over multiple sentences in a single sentence.

Advances in AI are making it possible to extract information from documents and other sources with a high degree of accuracy using only a small number of training examples. This is unlocking new potential for products and services that can help people in their work.

## Use cases

Automating the process of information extraction can help save time and improve efficiency in cases where large volumes of are data are being processed in a manual way.

It could also unlock new uses of data that would not be possible without a large degree of automation. For example, building a large database of structured information that be used for search. These applications allow faster access to the most relevant information for the purpose at hand. They have the potential to improve awareness, insight, and decision-making.

Some broad categories of use case include:

- Filtering and summarisation - extracting only the information that is most important or relevant to a specific purpose, reducing the amount of information that needs to be processed at a later stage in a process.
- Structuring/transforming - converting/restructuring data into a format that is required or better suited to the task. For example, extracting a list of ingredients from a recipe and putting them into a list.
- Classification/organisation - Identifying and listing concepts within the text to serve as labels that describe the content of a document, which can then be used to organise/group it with other documents that have similar topics.

Now let's explore specific domain areas where information extraction could be used to build products that help people in their work.

## Application areas

# Action vs Reflection - Know When to Flow

Our culture emphasises the importance of analysis and reflection. For good reason: it's the mechanism by which we come to better know ourselves, our strengths and weaknesses, which ultimately guides us in future decisions.

Analysis and reflection aren't always the answer however. Sometimes, it's about letting go and just flowing.

I see this idea in Hemingway's "write drunk, edit sober". In the act of creation or execution, one should be free from analysis and judgement, to best facilitate the flow of ideas.

I was inspired to reflect on this when I heard jiu-jitsu instructor Jon Thomas recommend not thinking about what you're doing during live action. Instead just do what comes naturally and spontaneously. 

The same concept can be applied to social situations, where being spontaneous and removing filters from what we say or do can lead to a richer, more authentic and more fulfilling experience. 

The key is to be mindful of our mindset and to recognise what mindset is best suited to the situation at hand. When it's time to act, let go of analysis and simply be in the moment. E`mbrace the controlled fall of improvation. When it's time to reflect and improve, take the time to analyse, plan and adjust.

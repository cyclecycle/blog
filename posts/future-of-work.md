# The Future of Work in an AI-Powered World

The skills I have are becoming easier to match with new technology, and I feel that my value as a programmer will soon decrease. What directions can I choose now to give me the best chance of continuing to create value in the future?

## Why have value?

To have value is to offer something others want. The more special or not readily available the thing you offer is, the more valuable it is. In my case, the ability to turn ideas into programs that people can use and benefit from gives me value.

I use the value I have to trade for resources. Therefore, I like having value.

It's possible that in the future this sense of 'having value' will matter less, because we won't need to trade for resources, which will be plentiful. But here I'm concerned with the short-term, and finding new ways to add value, because I believe the growth and spread of these technologies is inevitable, and that having value will continue to be important.

## Levels of work

We talk about lower-level and higher-level work. Lower-level work is closer to the detail of producing the product or service, such as putting the nuts and bolts of a car together, or writing the code that makes a website work. Higher-level work is further removed from the detail, and involves managing a broader set of processes, such as managing a team of people who build cars, or making decisions about what products to make.

## Abstracting away the details

The main pattern of development in technology is to systematise lower-level work, such that it can be done by machines, or more easily by humans. For example, a sieve is a tool that separates small parts from larger parts. It abstracts away the minute details of separating individual parts by hand. This allows the user more time to focus on a broader goal. For example, a farmer can use a sieve to spend less time separating wheat from chaff, and more time on expanding his farm.

In programming, higher-level programming languages make it easier to write programs by abstracting away the details of the machine. In the same way, AI will make it easier to build products by abstracting away the details of programming.

## Greener pastures

The conclusion is that as technology improves, it makes lower-level work easier to do, decreasing its value. This means we must find value in increasingly higher-level work.

This means working with an increasingly broad and more abstract set of ideas and processes. For me, I believe this means spending more time thinking about the ideas, connections, and relationships that I can bring to the table, and less time on the details of the work itself.

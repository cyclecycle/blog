# Introducing OpenPlayground:<br/>The One-Stop Shop for Language Model Experimentation and Application

At [GroundedAI](https://groundedai.company), we just released an application called [OpenPlayground](https://openplayground.groundedai.company). It's a tool that allows you to experiment with and run state-of-the-art language models directly from the browser. Check it out at [OpenPlayground](https://openplayground.groundedai.company). It is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/groundedai/openplayground).

## Compare models and providers in one place

_Large Language Models_ (LLMs) are machine learning models that are dominating the field with their powerful language understanding and creation abilities.

Currently, you can use them via APIs provided by companies such as [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), [Cohere](https://cohere.ai/) and [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/). Each of these has their own API and provides access to a variety of models.

One of the challenges is to be able to test out different models from different providers and compare them. We wanted to make this easier. This is one of the reasons we built OpenPlayground.

**OpenPlayground provides a single interface for using different LLMs**. This way you can switch between them and compare their outputs.

## Run LLMs on your data

Once you've found a setup that works well for your task, the next step is to run it on your data.

Let's say you've developed a preset that allows you summarise a document, or extract key relationships or mentions from a document in a way that fits your unique use case. You then want to apply this preset to a larger collection of documents to get the results you need and benefit from the automation.

For many use cases this is a critical step to actually get value from this technology. Currently, you would need to write your own code to do this. This is prohibitive for many users. We see an opportunity to make this step much easier.

**OpenPlayground provides a simple interface for running LLMs on your data**. You can upload a file and run it through a preset that you have developed in the playground. You can then inspect the results and download the output.

## Future ideas

The first release offers just the basic functionality. We have a lot of ideas for how to improve it and make it more useful. Here are some of the things we are thinking about working on next:

- **More providers** - We want to add more providers to OpenPlayground, to help users discover and compare across a more comprehensive range of models.
- **Better provider integration** - We want to make it easier to integrate new models and providers and keep them up to date.
- **More presets** - OpenAI and Cohere have done a great job of providing good presets which help guide and inspire users. OpenPlayground should follow this with a great library of built-in presets.
- **Automatic preset builder** - We envisage a feature that allows you to choose between multiple model outputs. This then provides the feedback to automatically select the best settings and prompt for their task.
- **Better comparison** - We want to make it easier to compare the outputs of different models and providers, with a better interface and more metrics.
- **Scale up** - We want to make it easy to scale up the processing of large amounts of data, to make it possible to run LLMs on larger datasets, so that users can upload and process greater amounts of data.

## Open source and available

OpenPlayground has been open sourced and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/groundedai/openplayground).

We think the idea of an open playground is hugely beneficial to advance the application and adoption of LLMs. We hope that by making it open source, we can help others to build on it and make it better.

One of the advantages of it being open source is that it's easy to add new providers. If you are interested in adding a provider, please get in touch via our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/groundedai/openplayground/issues).

Another advantage is that if you are developing LLMs internally, you can download the code and run it on your own infrastructure. This way, you can keep your data and models private while still benefiting from the OpenPlayground interface.

## Get in touch

If you have any questions, feedback or ideas for collaboration, please get in touch via our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/groundedai/openplayground/issues) or on the [Grounded AI contact page](https://www.groundedai.company/contact-us). We'd love to hear from you.

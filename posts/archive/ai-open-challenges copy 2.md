# The Challenges Ahead:<br />A Look at the Open Problems in AI

Here we look at the open problem areas in AI, and the areas of research that can address them.

## Open challenges - Maximising the potential of AI

The challenges of AI is to build systems that maximise the following traits:

- **Intelligence**
- **Adaptability**
- **Efficiency**
- **Interpretability**
- **Morality**
- **Collaborativeness**
- **Applicability**

We will now look at each of these challenges in more detail.

### Intelligence

**What is it?** - The ability to learn, reason, and solve complex problems.

**The benefits** - Increasingly intelligent systems can help solve harder problems, improve decision making, and automate tasks that would be difficult or impossible for humans to perform.

**The goal** - To create systems that exhibit super intelligent behavior, surpassing human intelligence in all areas.

#### Current state

Machine learning algorithms, particularly neural networks, have enabled systems to learn from data without explicit programming. Purely as a result of predictive modelling, systems have been able to exhibit increasingly intelligent behaviour, allowing them to tasks such as recognizing objects in images, understanding natural language, and playing complex games.

There is still a gap between the capabilities of current AI systems and the abilities of human intelligence however. Current systems are becoming very powerful in specific domains, but are considered narrow. Systems will need to become more general and able to learn from a wider range of data and situations.

#### Relation to other problem areas

The problem of intelligence is closely related to the other open problems, such as _adaptability_, _interpretability_, and _ethics_. For example, greater intelligence may enable AI systems to learn and adapt more quickly and effectively, allowing them to operate in changing environments and solve new problems. However, this increased intelligence may also make it more difficult to interpret the decisions and predictions of these systems, as they may become more complex and opaque.

In addition, greater intelligence may also raise ethical concerns, as more advanced AI systems may be able to make more complex and sophisticated decisions that can impact people's lives. This may require greater transparency and accountability in the design and operation of these systems, to ensure that they are fair and responsible.

### Adaptability

**What is it?** - The ability of a system to adapt and change in response to new information or contexts.

**The benefits** - Adaptable systems can operate in a wider range of contexts and environments, improving their flexibility and generalisability. This can be particularly useful in real-world applications where conditions may change over time.

**The goal** - Create systems that are able to adapt to new situations and environments quickly and effectively.

#### Current state

AI systems have mostly been designed to work in specific contexts and environments. It has been difficult to apply them to real-world settings where conditions may change.

Recent developments, such as transfer learning and meta-learning, have enabled systems to adapt to new situations more quickly and effectively. These techniques allow systems to learn from a smaller amount of data and to generalize their knowledge to new contexts.

However, there is still much work to be done in this area to create truly adaptable systems that can operate effectively in a wide range of environments.

#### Relation to other problem areas

The problem of adaptability is closely related to other open problems, such as intelligence, interpretability, and ethics. For example, greater adaptability may enable AI systems to learn from a wider range of data and situations, allowing them to become more intelligent and capable. However, this increased adaptability may also make it more difficult to interpret the decisions and predictions of these systems, as they may be based on a broader range of inputs and assumptions.

In addition, greater adaptability may also raise ethical concerns, as more advanced AI systems may be able to adapt to new situations in ways that are unforeseen or unintended. This may require greater attention to the values and principles that guide the design and operation of these systems, to ensure that they align with the goals and interests of individuals and society.

### Efficiency

**The goal** - To create systems that are able to be readily used to solve real-world problems and achieve specific goals.

#### Current state

AI systems have traditionally been designed to work in specific contexts and environments. This has limited their ability to be readily used to solve real-world problems and achieve specific goals.

Recent developments in machine learning and AI techniques have enabled systems to be more applicable in a wider range of settings. For example, transfer learning and meta-learning allow systems to learn from a smaller amount of data and to generalize their knowledge to new contexts.

However, there is still much work to be done in this area to create truly applicable systems that can be readily used to solve real-world problems and achieve specific goals in a wide range of environments and scenarios.

#### Relation to other problem areas

The problem of applicability is closely related to other open problems, such as intelligence, adaptability, and collaboration. For example, greater applicability may enable AI systems to become more intelligent and adaptable, allowing them to solve a wider range of problems and achieve specific goals. However, this increased applicability may also require greater collaboration between different AI systems and agents, to ensure that they are able to work together effectively and efficiently.

In addition, greater applicability may also raise ethical concerns, as more advanced AI systems may be able to achieve specific goals in ways that are unforeseen or unintended. This may require greater attention to the values and principles that guide the design and operation of these systems, to ensure that they align with the goals and interests of individuals and society.

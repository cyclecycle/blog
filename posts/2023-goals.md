Plans and priorities change. So too might this list. All that matters is that it helps me do the things I want to do.

Here's a more detailed explanation of each goal:

### Health and fitness

Health and fitness is number one so these goals come first.

#### Morning walker

I spend most of my time in front of a computer. I may be missing out on the benefits of sun exposure.

Exposure to sunlight in the morning in particular is supposed to improve sleep quality (as popularised by Andrew Huberman). So this habit seems to get the most bang for the buck.

#### Mindful monkey

I've found mindfulness practice to be beneficial, but difficult to maintain. This goal puts it on the board as something I intend to get done.

#### Biohacker

I will see if a device can help me increase awareness of how my heart rate and breathing quality change in response to situations and help me learn to influence those measures in a positive way.

#### Sports goals: Warrior, Squirrel, Plank, GigaChad, Otter, Aces high, Yogi bear

Show up, get the reps in, enjoy moving.

#### Ice blaster

This one's for brutes. Supposedly good for you too.

#### Pummel horse

How beneficial will sports massages be in helping me recover from lingering musculoskeletal issues? Let's find out.

### Business

#### Value hunter

I've always been focused on technical work and product development. Never taken responsibility for creating value from a sales perspecetive. I'm committing to developing in this area and delivering results.

#### Mingler

I've found networking events to be worthwhile. But mostly I've treated with them too low a priority. This goal is a commitment to showing up in 2023.

### Content creation

Creating and sharing content helps me learn and connect with others, which I like. It supports my other goals too.

### Social

#### Gig goer

Do the research, show up, and support the scene.

#### Friend collector

Meeting people is good. This one's about making more effort to connect with people.

I'm using the word "friend" liberally. For it to count, I need to create the possibility to follow-up (e.g., connect on social platforms or exchange of contact details).

### Construction and home improvement

#### All the gear

This one's about getting the cumulative benefits of physical work: improving my environment, developing new skills, and benefiting from physical activity.

#### Printer

As a member of the Cambridge MakeSpace I have access to 3D printers. Seems worth learning how to use.

### Exploration

My goals in this category are about getting more novelty into my life.

## How I chose the goals

- Wrote a list of things I feel like I care about doing or improving. The use of high level categories, e.g., health, business, etc. was helpful.
- Came up with goals that were simple and measurable.
- Ranked them order of importance to me.
- The hard part is deciding how to high to set the bar. I could break the goals down to a daily or weekly level to help me judge how realistic it is. But I'm going to skip that. What I have seems achievable so I'll go with it.

## The plan

I've set yearly goals before but never achieved them. I put this down to lack of planning, and lack of the right habits to stick to a plan.

I've set up a system to track my progress. I use the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) note-taking app. Every day I have a new daily note where I record actions and notes. I've had this habit for a long time so I know it works for me. In my daily note template I've set up a dashboard that shows my progress on my goals. Here's what it looks like at the beginning of the year:

<img src="Pasted image 20221230125537.png" alt="Pasted image 20221230125537.png" border="0">

Here's what it might look like later in the year:

<img src="Pasted image 20221230132307.png" alt="Pasted image 20221230132307.png" border="0">

Red means I'm behind the expected progress (assuming linear progress). Green means I'm on track.
